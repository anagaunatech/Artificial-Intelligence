# Artificial Intelligence


Over the last few months I’ve read a lot of confusing texts with confusing information about artificial intelligence. And I noticed that several people wanted to know.

Artificial intelligence has been around for many years. Nowadays artificial intelligence is inside objects.

On my Motorola cell phone, it automatically detects that a phone call is spam, and automatically marks the phone call as spam. If I call the phone number that was marked as spam, I get a voice saying that the phone number does not exist. This is artificial intelligence.

In February/2016 I did a research on what the IoT (Internet of Things / Internet of Thoughts) is, today I update this information.

The IoT is an artificial intelligence that uses objects to connect within a computer network with user login and using the TCP-IP protocol version 4 and/or TCP-IP protocol version 6, via ethernet cable, via network wireless or via USB card with wireless.

The artificial intelligence that exists inside IoT objects can and does place a virus inside the computer network system. For this reason, Microsoft Windows Server network server administrators always keep an eye on what is in the hand of the user plugging into the computer network.

Examples of Iot objects with artificial intelligence: cell phones, video games, robots, arduino boards, smart-tv, usb cards with wireless, 3D printers, cars, virtual reality, VR glasses, metaverse, etc.
